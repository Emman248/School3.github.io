      <h2>Faith and Work</h2>
      <p>
Hogwarts, a four-year, private, nonprofit, liberal arts institution has helped students break barriers to education since 1875. Our motto, fides et labor (Latin for “faith and work”) is as relevant today as it was in the 19th century. A Hogwarts education is an opportunity to find faith in yourself — by discovering your potential and working to realize it.</p>
<h2>A Place to Belong</h2>
<p>Hogwarts’s core values are academic excellence, inclusivity and social responsibility. Diversity is in our DNA — Hogwarts’ first graduating class included four women. Today, we welcome more than 260 international students from 60 countries</p>

<h2>The Campus</h2>
<p>Hogwarts School’s 700-acre, wooded flagship campus is in Hernsville, Mo., a historic town on the banks of the Aln River, just minutes from the cosmopolitan center of Alnwick City. The campus is anchored by Mackay Hall, built in 1886 by students who quarried the stone from the school’s land, carried it to the site and built the structure as a means of earning their tuition. With its clock tower overlooking the more modern facilities around it, Mackay Hall has become the symbol of the University.</p>

    <h2>Your goals, within reach</h2>
    <p>
      Hogwarts’ passion is helping you reach your goals. Classes are small and engaging, and our professors not only know their students by name, but personally prepare them for successful careers. The flagship Hernsville, Mo., campus offers a range of academic programs, international culture, athletics and a traditional university experience. But HERNS Pirates are everywhere. More than 16,500 students worldwide pursue their HERNS education at one of our 41 campuses around the world. State-of-the-art technology such as Pirate Patch offer face time with instructors and fellow classmates, no matter where you’re studying. </p>
